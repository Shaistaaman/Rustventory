# Rustventory

Rustventory is a robust inventory management system built with the Rust programming language, designed for small retail stores. It offers essential features for adding, editing, and deleting products, generating clear inventory reports, and handling errors gracefully. Rustventory prioritizes performance, security, and a user-friendly text-based interface for efficient inventory tracking. Core components include:

- Inventory Management: Track product name, description, price, and quantities.
- Reporting: Generate user-friendly, easily readable inventory reports.
- Error Handling: Robust validation and error handling mechanisms.
- Basic Security: Simple authentication to protect inventory data.

## Vision Statement:

Rustventory aims to revolutionize inventory management for small businesses, empowering them with efficient, reliable, and secure tools to streamline their operations. We envision a world where inventory tracking is no longer a source of stress, freeing retailers to focus on growth and customer satisfaction. Rustventory's accuracy and ease of use will help businesses minimize waste, optimize stock levels, and ultimately enhance their bottom line.

## Rustventory Software Development Plan:

### 1. Project Setup & Dependencies:

Configure the development environment with Rust and necessary libraries (e.g., error handling, text manipulation).
Define project structure and initialize source code management (e.g., Git).

### 2. Data Structures & Functions:

Design structures like Product (name, description, price, quantity) and Inventory (collection of products).
Implement functions for adding, editing, deleting products, and generating reports in user-friendly formats.
Develop error handling mechanisms to ensure data integrity and user feedback.

### 3. User Interface (Text-based):

Design a text-based menu system using println! and read_line! functions.
Provide clear options for adding, editing, deleting, reporting, and exiting the program.
Implement user-friendly prompts and error messages for smooth interaction.

### 4. Security & Authentication:

Implement basic authentication using username and password for access control.
Consider secure storage for sensitive data like passwords (e.g., hashing).

### 5. Testing & Refinement:

Conduct thorough unit testing for individual functions and integration testing for overall system functionality.
Refine code based on identified issues and user feedback.

### 6. Deployment & Documentation:

Choose a suitable deployment method (e.g., compiled binary, web application) based on target environment.
Create clear documentation explaining installation, usage, and features of Rustventory.
Note: This plan focuses on core functionalities and text-based UI.

### Additional Features (Optional):

Implement file I/O to save and load inventory data for persistence.
Explore integration with external libraries for advanced features like database support or graphical user interface.

## Installation Guide:

### Prerequisites:

Rust: Download and install Rust from the official website: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install. Ensure you have rustc and cargo available in your system path.

### Steps:

- Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rustventory.git
```

- Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd rustventory
```

- Build the project:

```
cargo build
```

- Running the application:

Once the build is successful, you can run the program:

```
./target/debug/rustventory
```

- Run the project:

```
cargo run
```

This will start the Rustventory application with a text-based interface.

### Note:

This guide assumes a Linux or macOS environment. Windows users may need additional steps to set up the development environment.
